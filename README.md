# Web Scraper Dashboard

This project utilizes Python and Selenium for web scraping. It collects headlines from a chosen news website, analyzes the data, and presents the findings through visualizations using Matplotlib and WordCloud. The results are displayed via a Flask-based web interface.

## Features

- **Headline Scraping:** Extracts headlines from a selected news website.
- **Word Frequency Analysis:** Examines the frequency of words within the headlines.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Assesses the sentiment of headlines (positive, negative, or neutral).
- **Topic Modeling:** Identifies prevalent topics within the headlines using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
- **Phrase Generation:** Creates a phrase using a subset of the most frequent words.
- **Web Interface:** Presents the results through a web interface developed with Flask.
